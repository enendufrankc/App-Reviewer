  "outcome": "Accepted",
   "rationale": "The candidate, Mr. Frannk, meets all the specified eligibility criteria. He was born on 14/01/1997, making him 27 years old at the time of application (well under the 30-year age limit). He holds a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) in Petroleum and Gas Engineering with a Second Class Upper division, which satisfies the requirement for a First Class or Second Class Upper degree (or equivalent). While the details of his postgraduate education are not provided, the criteria state that master's degree holders are welcome but do not require a master's degree for eligibility. There is no evidence of any disqualifying factors. The candidate's application materials, including his essay and CV, demonstrate strong motivation, relevant experience, and clear communication skills, but the decision is based strictly on the explicit eligibility criteria, all of which are met."
